# SNHU CS360: Mobile Architecture & Programming


#### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
<p>
    The event tracker app was designed to address the needs of users who want to efficiently manage and organize their personal and professional events. It aims to provide a user-friendly platform for creating, scheduling, and tracking events, as well as setting reminders and receiving notifications.
</p>

#### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
<p>
    The event tracker app required several key screens and features to effectively support user needs and provide a user-centered UI. The event tracker app presents the user with a login screen and allows the user to log in or sign up on the signup screen. Once logged in, the user is presented with the events screen which includes a floating action button to create events. When the user clicks the floating action button, they are presented with the create event screen and can create an event. Once an event is created, the user is sent back to the events screen where the new event is now presented alongside an edit button for the event. Lastly, clicking the edit button presents the user with the event details screen where they can either edit or delete that event. 
</p>

<p>
    To ensure the UI designs keep users in mind, I focused on intuitive navigation and consistent design. By incorporating these additional screens and features, along with following user-centered design principles, the event tracker app provides a comprehensive and engaging experience for users.
</p>


#### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
<p>
    I approached the process of coding the event tracker app by focusing on modularization, object-oriented design, and testing. These techniques can be applied to future app development projects to improve code quality, maintainability, and efficiency. By breaking down code into smaller, independent modules, using OOP principles, following clean code practices, and utilizing testing, I can create more robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.

#### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
<p>
    I made sure my code was functional
